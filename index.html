                <p>My Wife, My Dearest, Serenity</p>
                <p>I’m writing this because I need to take full responsibility for being a jerk to you when we spoke. I let a vivid, traumatic nightmare—one where I felt I had lost you in the worst way completely cloud my reality and dictate how I treated you. I woke up with my heart feeling numb and devastated, and instead of being a mature partner and communicating that I was struggling with a bad dream, I unfairly projected all that pain onto you. I realize now how wrong it was to punish you for something that only happened in my mind, and I am deeply sorry for letting my fears override the love and trust we have built together.</p>
                <p>What hurts me the most is realizing that after your long, exhausting day, you likely came to me looking for comfort and "lambing," only to be met with my misplaced attitude. As your husband and best friend, I should have been your safe harbor and your peace, but I failed to protect our connection when you needed it most. I am reaching out now because I want us to have closure on this; I don’t want to make the situation any worse by letting this tension linger. I value you more than my own insecurities, and I hope you can forgive me for my lack of grace so we can get back to sharing our lives with the warmth you deserve.</p>
